## Process

### Data Transformation Process
To prepare the dataset for analysis, I used Microsoft Excel for an initial review, ensuring data cleanliness, and Tableau for visualization. The dataset contains both categorical (qualitative) and numerical (quantitative) data, including string, numerical, and boolean values.

In **Tableau**, I created parameters and the following calculated fields also organized them into respective folders:

* Incoming Call
* Average Talk Time
* Customer Satisfaction (C Sat)
* First Contact Resolution Call (FCRC)

#### Incoming Call Folder
* Incoming call: COUNT([Call ID]).
* calculated Current Month (CM) Incoming Call:
COUNT(IF [Current Month] = MONTH([Call Timestamp])
THEN [Call ID]
END).
* Previous Month (PM) Incoming call: COUNT(IF [Current Month] -1 = MONTH([Call Timestamp])
THEN [Call ID]
END).
* Month over Month (MOM) Incoming call: [CM Incoming Call]/[PM Incoming Call]-1.
MOM color: SIGN([MOM Incoming Calls]).

#### Average Talk Time Folder
* Average Talk Time: AVG(IF [Abandon Flag] != ‚ÄòY‚Äô
THEN [Call Duration (in Minutes)]
END).
* CM Avg Talk Time: AVG(
IF[Current Month]= MONTH([Call Timestamp])
AND [Abandon Flag] != ‚Äòy‚Äô
THEN [Call Duration (in Minutes)]
END).
* PM Avg Talk Time: AVG(
IF[Current Month]-1 = MONTH([Call Timestamp])
AND [Abandon Flag] != ‚Äòy‚Äô
THEN [Call Duration (in Minutes)]
END).
* MOM Avg Talk Time: [CM Avg Call]/[PM Avg Call]-1
* MOM Avg talk Color: SIGN([MOM Avg Talk Time]).

#### Csat Score Folder
* CM Csat Score: AVG(IF[Current Month]= MONTH([Call Timestamp])
AND [Abandon Flag] != ‚Äòy‚Äô
THEN [CSAT Score]
END).
* PM Csat Score: AVG(IF[Current Month]-1 = MONTH([Call Timestamp])
AND [Abandon Flag] != ‚Äòy‚Äô
THEN [CSAT Score]
END).
* Avg Csat Score: AVG(IF [Abandon Flag] != ‚ÄòY‚Äô
THEN [CSAT Score]
END).
* MOM Csat Score: [CM Cast Call]/[PM Csat Call]-1
* MOM Csat Score Color: SIGN([MOM Cast Call])

#### FCRC Folder
* FCRC: COUNT( IF[First Contact Resolution (FCR) Flag] = ‚ÄòY‚Äô
AND [Abandon Flag] != ‚ÄòY‚Äô
THEN [Call ID]
END)
* CM FCRC: COUNT(IF[Current Month]= MONTH([Call Timestamp])
AND([First Contact Resolution (FCR) Flag]) = ‚ÄòY‚Äô
AND [Abandon Flag] != ‚ÄòY‚Äô
THEN [Call ID]
END)
* PM FCRC: COUNT(IF[Current Month]-1 = MONTH([Call Timestamp])
AND([First Contact Resolution (FCR) Flag]) = ‚ÄòY‚Äô
AND [Abandon Flag] != ‚ÄòY‚Äô
THEN [Call ID]
END)
* MOM FCRC: [CM FCRC Call]/[PM First Contact Resolution Call ]-1
* MOM FCRC Color: SIGN([MOM FCRC])

These transformations allowed for better structuring and analysis of key performance indicators.
